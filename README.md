# THREE ONCE

**Three Once** is a Game Jam game, developed by myself for the [Game Maker Toolkit Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019) in 2 days. The theme of the Jam was "**ONLY ONE**".

You can try it [here](https://delunado.itch.io/three-once) on your browser or download it [here](https://github.com/Delunado/ThreeOnce-JamGame/raw/master/Build/Windows/Windows.zip) for Windows!

### What's Three Once about?
Three Once is a *puzzled platformer* where you play as a broken robot. This scrappy robot has to reach the door on each level, and for this purpose he can do three things, besides moving: jumping, shooting and dashing. But, as he is broken, he can only do each one only *once*!

So you have to figure out how to complete each level, using the abilities properly. Also, you can only touch each ground tile once. If you touch it twice, you'll die! :(

### Tools
- **[Unity](https://unity.com/)** as the game engine. 
- **[Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)** as the IDE.
- **[Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)** for the pixel art.
- **[Bosca Ceoil](https://boscaceoil.net/)** for the music.
- **[BFXR](https://www.bfxr.net/)** for the SFX.
- **Pen and some paper** for the game & level design! 

### Credits

I [(@Devlunado)](https://twitter.com/Delunad0) did everything, from the code to the visual art, including music and sfx, except for a piece of code I used for the screen fade effect between levels.  

So, if you check the source code, it may not be perfect or production-level. That's because I had only 48 hours to complete the entire game! 

I had a lot of fun. It was a challenge to complete the game alone in such a short amount of time, but I achieved it! I would repeate the experience.

Thank you for reading :)
